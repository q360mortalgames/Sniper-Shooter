v4.0
NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE
- NavMesh Agent movement script added

v3.2
-  hoMove: configurable starting point (does not work with looptype random) 
-  hoMoveMinimal: new performance efficient version of hoMove, without 
messages, delays and looptype random. Does not use partial paths  
-  New example scenes: camera flythrough & rapid input (see webplayer) 
-  New FX script: PathIndicator component spawns particles along a path  
-  Experimental: new components MoveRenderer & PathRenderer allow 
rendering of tweens (hoMove) or paths (PathManager) at runtime by using 
Line Renderers 
-  Project restructured for easier browsing (Assets, Examples, Plugins, Scripts) 
-  “Place to Ground” setting on path managers works with 2D and 3D colliders 
-  hoMove: fixed triggering of messages at the last waypoint 

v3.1.1
-  Waypoint Manager: 2D Mode added for dedicated waypoint placement in 2D 
-  PlayMaker: added addon package with more than 10 new custom actions for
controlling different aspects of paths and walker objects, a sample scene that
demonstrates them and better documentation about all custom actions 

v3.1
-  Complete rewrite of bezier paths. Now they fully work in 3D: You can move, 
rotate or do other fancy stuff with them at runtime – instantiation works too 
-  Path components now draw handlers for waypoints for repositioning them 
without the need to actually select them 
-  iMove/hoMove: fixed null reference when calling Reset() before StartMove() 
-  hoMove/bezierMove: fixed weird rotation on using orientToPath+LockAxis 
-  Path components: re-visited waypoint naming and forced to array order 
-  Path components: gizmo and line drawing moved to WaypointManager 
-  WaypointManager: changed path buttons to selection field for path type 
-  Scripts: added “About” window to Window > Simple Waypoint System 
-  Scripts: added Undo functionality for Unity 4.3.x 
-  PlayMaker support: added SetPath action for bezier paths (SetBezierPath) 
-  Example Scenes: re-created Example_Bezier 

v3.0.3
-  hoMove: fixed bug where stopping movement at a waypoint could potentially stop 
executing other messages 
-  iMove: fixed Stop() method 

v3.0.2
-  hoMove: fixed Exception when destroying tween while moving via Stop() 
-  WaypointManager.cs: added waypoint renaming scheme on path creation 
-  PathManager, BezierPathManager: gizmos consider new waypoint names 

v3.0.1
-  hoMove: fixed NullReferenceException when accessing an empty tween 

v3.0
-  Bezier paths! (only 2D - x,z axis -  for now) 
-  At the cost of some movement settings, bezier paths give you more control 
over the shape of your path: drag small handlers per waypoint in order to 
further define the curves 
-  WaypointManager: now creates normal or bezier paths 
-  BezierPathManager, BezierPathEditor and bezierMove scripts added 
-  bezierMove can trigger messages anywhere on the path, at a given 
percentage – not restricted to waypoint positions 
-  New example scene “Example_Bezier” 
-  WaypointEditor: changed waypoint placement combination from alt + mouse  
-  click to keyboard key ‘P’. Auto-focuses scene view when starting a new path  
-  hoMove: fixed an issue where Pause() + Resume() could affect other tweens  
-  hoMove: added slot for an animation curve when using a custom easetype 
-  HOTween: updated to v1.1.727
